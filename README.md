# Arduino-Robot

This program was created for an Arduino Uno robot shield to be able to navigate around a basic course.
The robot needed to follow a line until it encountered an obstacle. The robot is then required to go around the obstacle and then find the line again on the other side. After finding the line, the robot would follow the line until it scans a pattern of black and white spaces beneath the robot that the robot reads and then processes as an instruction. Then the robot will carry out that instruction.
